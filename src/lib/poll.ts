/**
 * The poll run — find new uploads on tracked sources, fetch their captions, and
 * submit the analysis work as a Batch API job (PLAN.md §1.2).
 *
 * This lives in `src/lib` rather than in `scripts/poll-sources.ts` because two
 * callers need it: the CLI script, and the `/api/cron/poll` route handler that
 * Hostinger's cron hits over HTTP. The route handler must not shell out to the
 * script — a Next.js server process spawning `tsx` would double the memory
 * footprint on a shared Node slot, lose the error, and give the caller nothing
 * but an exit code.
