/**
 * [PR-36] The addressable content unit.
 *
 * Listen mode does not play an audio file, so there is no timestamp to seek to.
 * What it plays is a list of *units* — one takeaway, one timeline beat, one
 * idea — spoken one after another. Position is therefore "which unit", not
 * "how many seconds in", and that is the right granularity anyway: the thing a
 * listener wants to come back to is a takeaway, not a moment.
 *
 * This module is the single definition of that list, deliberately pure and
 * database-free: the player (client) walks it to speak, the reading view
 * (server) walks it to hang a star off each section, and PR-37's marks point
 * at `(type, index)` from it. If the two ever disagreed about what unit 3 is,
 * a mark made while listening would land on different text when read back.
 *
 * The order is PLAN.md §4's contract order, which is also the order the
 * reading view renders: summary → takeaways → hook → timeline → gaps → ideas.
